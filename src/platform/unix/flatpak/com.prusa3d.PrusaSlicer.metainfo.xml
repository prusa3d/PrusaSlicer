    <description>
        <p>
            PrusaSlicer takes 3D models (STL, OBJ, AMF) and converts them into G-code
            instructions for FFF printers or PNG layers for mSLA 3D printers. It's
            compatible with any modern printer based on the RepRap toolchain, including all
            those based on the Marlin, Prusa, Sprinter and Repetier firmware. It also works
            with Mach3, LinuxCNC and Machinekit controllers.
        </p>
        <p>
            PrusaSlicer is based on Slic3r by Alessandro Ranelucci and the RepRap community.
        </p>

                <p>PrusaSlicer 2.3.3 is a patch release following PrusaSlicer 2.3.2 release, fixing an unfortunate bug in handling FDM multi-material

        <release version="2.3.2" date="2021-07-08">
            <description>
                <p>This is a final release of PrusaSlicer 2.3.2, following 2.3.2-beta and 2.3.2-rc. 
                For the new features in the 2.3.2 series, please read the change logs of the beta and release candidate. 
                The final release is functionally equal to the release candidate, with a single additional improvement:
                Before installing profile updates, a configuration snapshot is taken. In rare circumstances when the current configuration is not consistent, 
                taking a configuration snapshot fails. PrusaSlicer 2.3.2 newly informs about the issue and offers either to install the configuration updates 
                even if taking the configuration snapshot failed or to abort update of the profiles.</p>
